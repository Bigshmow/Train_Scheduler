# Train_Scheduler
Week_7_Train_HomeWork

The project can create a train schedule table that tracks name, destination, next arrival, and frequency via Firebase.

Fill out the form input and hit submit to see your schedule above!

The goal of this project was to demonstrate firebase push and snapshot knowledge while also showing moment.js understanding.
